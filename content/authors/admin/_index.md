Rachel Vezza is a selfemployed consultant with a PhD of renewable energy engineering from the University of Edinburgh. She has an intrinsic curiosity and an exceptional urge to learn, to analyse and to understand. Her research interests are wide ranging - she loves to be challenged and to be given the opportunity to work in different fields.

Rachel is very quick to connect information from every possible source, be it numerical data, company reports, peer-reviewed journals, blogs, expert discussions and normal conversation. She is a great asset in brainstorming and strategic considerations.

With a skill in pattern recognition and a very sensitive perception, Rachel has a strong intuition. Having said that, she is a trained scientist and therefore places a high importance on objective analysis. The combination of the two, however, gives her insight into people and companies and allows her to thrive in the analysis of capabilities and in the sorting of possible options.

In her work as an engineer, she has learned to be very precise. Although her personal style prefers quick over perfectionistic, she is meticulous where it matters. This includes very thorough methods of organisation, planning and timekeeping.

What she can do for you:\
Being so versatile and keen to learn, she can be thrown at any project and any task. Quickly and without need for supervision will she analyse, sort, interpret, and suggest ways to go forward. She critiques diplomatically and honestly shares her opinions and worries. Her energy and unstoppable enthusiasm encourage cooperative working and she has a reputation to be very motivational.
