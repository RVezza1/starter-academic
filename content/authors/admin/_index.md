Rachel Vezza is a selfemployed consultant with a PhD in renewable energy engineering from the University of Edinburgh.  Her research interest is the future of the ocean - she loves challenges and working in the spaces between clear categories.

Rachel has an intrinsic curiosity and an exceptional urge to learn, to analyse and to understand. She is very quick to connect information from every possible source, be it numerical data, company reports, peer-reviewed journals, blogs, expert discussions and normal conversation. She is hence a great asset in brainstorming and strategic considerations.

With a skill in pattern recognition and a very sensitive perception, Rachel has a strong intuition. Having said that, she is a trained scientist and therefore places a high importance on objective analysis. The combination of the two, however, gives her insight into people and companies and allows her to thrive in the analysis of capabilities and judgement of possibilies. 

In her work as an engineer, she has learned to be very precise. Although her personal style prefers wholistic over detail oriented, she is meticulous where it matters. This includes very thorough methods of organisation, planning and timekeeping.
